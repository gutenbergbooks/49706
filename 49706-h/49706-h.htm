<p>Greeting</p>

<p>The stream of <span class="u2">Conquest</span> has
generally flowed from North to South. The Triumph
progress of the Goddess Nicotina has been from
West to East starting in the 16<sup>th.</sup> century she has
now girdled our little orb with devotees burning
continuous incense. The Instruments connected
herewith are objects of Historical &amp; Ethnographical
interest hence are brought together authentic
Portraits of the “Pipe Family”. Briar root and
Branch “who judge from the favor in which they
are now held.” “At home &amp; abroad” they seem
likely to flourish for ever. I cannot close without
expressing my thanks to Mr. Bernard Quaritels
for placing then before you in their present
Garb.</p>

this is the “Brass Tin” Period.
on all these scores “SMOKIANA” is strongly
represented bringing forward The “Brass”
Pipes of SUMATRA. It is surprising how
widely diffused is “STONE” especially “Soap
stone.” Amongst the following specimens
will be found our “Gourd.” Period—but
as there is “no place like Home” we will begin
with “English clays,” of which some are

<p class="hang1">The various stamps &amp; names of early
makers of Tobacco Pipes are most satisfactorily
corroborated by the Parish
Register and the families seem to have
gone on prospering, but the sickle “of Old
Time” has been put in &amp; . &amp; old things
have passed away making room for new.
The Four stamps given on the opposite
Page are amongst the Earliest known.
&amp; of great interest. The quality of the
Clay must have attracted the makers
to that spot—after the introduction of
Pipes to London, which had a Pipe
maker’s Company <span class="u">.A·D. 1619</span> &amp; still continues
establishments at Bow..
The “Old Cock” Tavern in Fleet Street
had its own Token &amp; its own Pipe.</p>

<p class="p2">and old London as revealed in digging
old foundations has yielded a great
harvest of Pipe produce.. The museum
at Guildhall has a very good collection.
The “Churchwarden” Clay was the Pipe
of the early part of this century &amp; is still
in the Country. It was considered right
always to have a clean pipe hence they
were stacked together in a double ring &amp;
sent to “The Bake-house” for Purification.
The “Irish Dudean” originated the rich
“old clay” most probably &amp; the Scotch
followed with Cutties, &amp; The French
with “Fiolets” bien “Cullottées”—of

<h3>HOLLAND.</h3>

<p class="hang1">The Dutch have always been great Smokers,
how often does Ostade introduce clay Pipes
into his pictures &amp; when they favored us with
a visit in 1689. how many records have
been dug up from time to time wherever
they were located. The Typical Pipe of
Holland is that of “<span class="u">GOUDA</span>” make. &amp;
The Pipe enters largely into Wedding
ceremonies thus they have for the
Copper wedding, the long clay Pipe
of some 36<sup>in.</sup> decorated with Copper leaves.
The Silver Wedding Silver leaves &amp;
The Golden Wedding Gold &amp; finally
The Diamond—for the 75<sup>th.</sup> now Cigars
are smoked by every one, even by
little Hollanders going to school</p>

<h3>GERMANY.</h3>

<p class="hang1">As a Nation of Smokers The Germans
have always carried the palm &amp; do
still &amp; with them Smoke &amp; Song were ever
inseparable. Imagine a German Student
without his Pipe, &amp; his Corps Cap
we should not know him. The Leading
feature in German Pipes is decidedly
The long Bowl of Porcelain generally
adorned with some Beauty on the front
of it in medallion form. The stems
are of great lengths some four feet or so
with flexible tubing leading up to the
mouth piece. These may be considered
House Pipes for travelling, naturally
they are shorter. The Tobacco Bags
are objects of great care &amp; interest.</p>

<h3>NORTH EUROPE.</h3>


<p class="hang1">The Island of “AMAGER” near Copenhagen
has retained its costumes &amp; customs
so faithfully that we have confidence
in the Pattern Pipes which are now
still in use. The Long one. 4 ft 8 in is
the House, the shorter one 6<sup>in.</sup> in the bowl
contains the allowance of Tobacco for
the day, this is the constant companion
of the out-door worker.</p>

<p class="hang1">In Norway small blocks of meerschaum
seem to be most in vogue.</p>

<p class="hang1">The Hungarian Pipes are of red clay.
&amp; show asiastic influence in form.</p>

<p class="hang1">The Tyrolese Pipes look very workman
like mostly of wood with Roebuck
horn—introduced as ornament—</p>

<h3>ALGERIA.</h3>

<p class="hang1">We are now in a new sphere of Pipe-Land:
a Kind of slack water between
European &amp; Asiatic systems—in which
the Turkish type predominates thus
the upper Red clay bowl on the opposite
page is quite Turkish &amp; the handsome
Arab Pipe of a form seen often smoked
riding on a Camel shews us how decoration
will now be introduced in a new
form. The Stem of this Pipe is beautiful
in Colour, the Ivory having a very
beautiful arabesque pattern upon it,
the red colour of which harmonises
delightfully with the dark wood &amp; bowl.
The Large bowl is decidedly for
House or Tent service.</p>

<h3>AFRICA.</h3>

<p class="hang1">Everywhere in the Dark Continent the
habit of smoking something or somehow
has been met with by our most energetic
explorers even in the dense forests of
new Equatoria. The Pigmies find it
desirable to have something to smoke.
Paul Du Chaillu in 1856 brought to our
notice the Pipes shewn at the top of the next
page. These are used by <span class="u">The Fans</span>, a fierce
Cannibal tribe—great in the mystery of
Iron work, and are generally made of red
or very dark clay. The Specimen
from <span class="u">SANKURU River LAT 5° S</span> is of
wood &amp; very beautifully carved.—The
Bone Pipe is very like a Cigar Holder</p>

<h4>LAGOS and Ashantee.</h4>

<p class="hang1">The Three Bowls of the dark clay bowl
are certainly a striking object to any
smoker.. and again the small bowl
from the larger one in fact “Bowl major.”
“Bowl Minor”—this plurality we shall
find in India, still that does not very
clearly explain the why &amp; wherefore—unless
it emanates from mere love of
being unlike others.. The Light coloured
Red Clay of the Ashantee Pipes is very
striking—&amp; the form of the Bowls still
more so. There is a decidedly Classical
character about them.. as if started
from Roman Lamps &amp; Pompeian ideas
&amp; then supplied to their Colonies—.</p>

<h4>EAST.</h4>

<p class="hang1">DAHOMEY is associated in our minds
with the most ghastly &amp; cruel scenes of
useless blood-shed. &amp; yet “TOBACCO” is
smoked there and gradually is the
Symbol of Peace asserting its gentle influence
&amp; Dahomey is now more humane
than when Capt. Burton first visited
it. To him we are indebted for the specimens
opposite. The long peculiarly
formed bowl like a “nepenthes” or Pitcher
Plant is of Iron &amp; has prongs or spurs
of Iron. Length of stem, 33 in. The
Hanging tufts are of Red Indian character.
The upper pipe is carved wood &amp;
the double one, Iron.</p>

The wooden Pipe with the Curious board
in front of the Bowl is used by the LOMWE
Tribe of MAKUAS on the <span class="u">LUKUGU River</span>
which runs into the “LAKE TANGANYIKA”—W.
and a very curious arrangement it is the
front of the board being elaborately carved.
The Two lower Pipes are large &amp; cumbersome
&amp; used to smoke Wild Hemp or
“Cannabis Indica” sometimes called
Banghi, but generally, “Bang”—In
India we find the same name applied
to a spirit obtained from Palms
into pots &amp; collected in the Deccan.</p>

The Ivory pipe of King MTESA from

<p class="hang1">Zanzibar at the present moment is a
centre of public interest and the example
given on the next page is an exceedingly
good one, it is of carved wood &amp; has much
of the ARAB character in its form.
The Large one is of wood also with good
ornamentation, the Bowl is 4<sup>in.</sup> in diam
and the total length 12<sup>in.</sup> this is used
for smoking Wild Hemp or Bang—and
sometimes known as. “<span class="u">LIAMBA</span>.”—it is
from <span class="u">NYASSA. LAT 9° S. LONG. 31.<sup>E.</sup></span> This is

<h4>BUSHMEN · S. AFRICA.</h4>

<p class="hang1">Now we arrive at the full swing of the
Stone Bowls of Soap stone or “<span class="u">STEATITE</span>”
and the link with the last “UGANDA” Pipe
will at once be recognised. The whole
machine is most cumbersome&amp; the
size therefore—The Horn being some 18<sup>in.</sup>
must make it bad for Bushwork. Altho
the tube can be unshipped most readily
The Stone Bowls are carved
with great care, the favorite form
reminds us of the maces or “Martel de

is found also the Duplex Bowl
also in Steatite.</p>

<h4>South Africa.</h4>

<p class="hang1">The “Steatite” Bowls now show decidedly
European influence, altho the most striking
feature is the under disc which is
probably added to give strength as the
Steatite itself is very friable, its form
reminds one of the inverted comb on the
skull of a Gorilla which is very African.
These specimens like many others are
from that Great Store House of information
The British Museum which happily
secured many of the interesting examples

<h3>TURKEY</h3>

<p class="hang1">Turkish tobacco is such a familiar
form &amp; so comprehensive in its light varieties
that Turkish pipes must at once
be called “<span class="u">CHIBOUQUES</span>” &amp; “<span class="u">HOOKAHS</span>”.
The red clay bowl of the former is
generally 2 in. in diameter. The stem
of Cherry or of Iasmine 5 ft long.
When the Bowl is primed it is covered
with thin paper &amp; prepared for lighting.
The Smoker at a range of 5 ft gives
the signal &amp; the light is applied—The
mouth piece of clouded amber
is very rounded &amp; therefore only
put to the lips.. The Red clay
Hand Hubble of Benares is very simple.</p>

to shew us the “Hookah” of Persia in
his day. his book was published 1669
and as travelling from TEHERAN to the
HOLY CITY was less rapid than nowadays,
we may fairly accept this
illustration as representing a well-established
object. The action of the
“Hookah” or “Hubble bubble” is to draw
the smoke through the water—&amp; so
cool &amp; purify the fumes of the Tobacco
Being made of Glass. This is called
a “<span class="u">SHISHEH</span>” &amp; in it is smoked the.

took India by storm &amp; the maharajahs
found in Hookahs a new object of luxury

which contains the tobacco is called</p>

<h4>SCINDE.</h4>

<p class="hang1">This is one of the Giants of the Red
ware Race is India. 18 inches in height
and is used in this north west Province
as a Village welcome to travellers &amp;
is generally found in the <span class="u">DAK Bungelow</span>.
In some parts of India a native
may be seen with his Public “Hookah”
all alight ready for the passer-by to
take a few whiffs—on paying a “consideration”
for the privilege &amp; refresher.
The lower form was given to the
writer by D<sup>r.</sup> Watts it is used by the
Hill Tribes of “<span class="u">CHITTAGONG</span>”: &amp; was
brought over here for the Colonial Exhibition
in <span class="u">1886</span>.</p>

<h4>MADRAS</h4>

<p class="hang1">As we are now leaving the “HOOKAH”
family &amp; coming to the “<span class="u">NARGHILES</span>”
it will be well to emphasize the
distinction between the two—which
is this—“NARGHILE” is the native
term for Cocoanut, hence all smoking
mediums of that kind such as must
be laid down &amp; will not stand erect
are called “NARGHILE”s especially of
Cocoanut shape. All “Hookahs” stand
by themselves. This bowl from <span class="u">N. ARCOT
MADRAS</span> is made of a Bronzed Ware
somewhat heavy but good form.
The Five topped Chillum is only seen
in the Bazaars not in general use.</p>

<h4>PROVINCE INDORE.</h4>

<p class="hang1">This is a true, good &amp; faithful representative
of the “<span class="u">NARGHILE</span>” Family, a real
Cocoanut pipe, mounted in Silver
with good native work. The shell has
evidently been selected for its graceful
shape. &amp; the native artificer has done his
work lovingly.. The “Chillums” beneath
are of different material that on the left
is of Silver &amp; although Sir Walter Raleigh
smoked a pipe of silver still in these
days in Europe all metals are avoided
for bowls. The Chillum on the right is
from “<span class="u">LUCKNOW</span>” perforated rim of
glazed Pottery. Biscuit colour ground
with green pattern &amp; Ruby spots or Knobs.</p>

<h3>YARKAND.</h3>

<p class="hang1">As Pipes are made out of every conceivable
material we cannot be surprised
that where “Iade” has its
habitat that there its services should
be enlisted &amp; utilized—&amp; so it is:
The “<span class="u">Yarkand</span>” River has much
Iade but to work it &amp; bore it for
a pipe must not only involve
great care &amp; consummate skill,
but necessitate rarity of production
The wooden &amp; more humble confrere
is much more general &amp;
very easily made anywhere.
The Dark clay “chillum” belongs
to a Gourd Pipe.</p>

<h4>YARKAND &amp; BOKHARA.</h4>

<p class="hang1">Having noticed the exceptional Iade
we come to the more common Gourd
Pipe in fact our “<span class="u">Gourd Period</span>”. They
are doubtless received with favor on
account of their lightness and the example
given is from one in the India
Museum where they seem to be of much
the same character. The Gourd of
about 12 inches in length. The wooden.
Bowl carrier curiously turned in

The ornamentation is in some cases
very elaborate in this case a mixture
of Persian &amp; Chinese.</p>

<h4>ASSAM · KHYBER &amp; BURMAH.</h4>

<p class="hang1">Bamboo is wonderfully useful in so many
ways &amp; now it comes before us as the very
simplest of Pipe Bowls, the joint forming
the base. This is north “Assam.”</p>

<p class="p2">The Pipe of the <span class="u">AFRIDI</span> tribe at the South
entrance to the <span class="u">KHYBER PASS</span> has a very
small brass bowl. Two pieces of wood are
scooped out for the bore &amp; bound together
with leather. This pipe is promoted to a
Wooden Case with carved ornamentation.
The Pipe of KAKHYEN N. IRRAWADDY RIV.
<span class="u">BURMAH</span> has a very long bowl, the

<h4>OPIUM</h4>


<p class="hang1">This is a serious matter
to approach especially as it
has a very bad character—and
has been black balled all round
&amp; generally tabooed. After careful research
&amp; unbiased study of its merits
&amp; demerits we must confess that it is
unduly maligned, as the most useful
of Colonists, The Chinese, work in all the
hottest &amp; most unhealthy parts of the world. &amp;
are generally very healthy which may be
attributed to the <span class="u">moderate use</span> of the
so called Demon <span class="u2">OPIUM</span>. The largest

<h3>JAPAN.</h3>


<p class="hang1">This most delightful country with its
kindly inhabitants are great Smokers
in a small measure if the regulation
size of the generally used bowl be
taken as a standard. Many people
fancy that the little Jap. bowls the
real size being thus.—are
used for Opium—not
at all. The Tobacco they use is very
light in Colour &amp; very fine cut indeed.
The full size of the general pipe is
given on the opposite page at the foot.
Their Tobacco pouchs are very artistically
worked &amp; ornamented their

<h3>BORNEO.</h3>

<p class="hang1">It always adds very greatly to the value
&amp; interest of any object for a collection if
it has been well used &amp; especially if
acquired from the original owner when
using it. Such was the Case with the
specimen of <span class="u">Dyak Pipe</span> &amp; Tobacco
Box now given. The Bamboo stem is
rather large according to our idea in
proportion to the Bowl. The Dyak is
equal to the occasion &amp; regulates the
draft by putting dry grass therein.
The wooden Bowl is very small. The
wire at the side is to slip into his girdle.
The Tobacco Box is a very rich brown,
the outer skin of the Bamboo being
Cut away to shew the pattern.</p>

well represented: The ACHEEN section
a little thin. &amp; the large brass pipes
from <span class="u">Batak-landen</span> are very
welcome. The British Museum has
one a little longer than the Iava

<h3>New ZEALAND.</h3>

<p class="hang1">Pipes seem to be a general register
of the art of the Country in which they
are made and in this case it is especially
useful at a transition period like
the present as when this class of ornamentation
is fast passing away.
This carved work on the basis of a real
Briar structure assumes a new type—below
the carving—as it goes off as a
spike to stick into the ground like
a linstock of old with the match ever
ready &amp; burning. The wood of this
example is very hard &amp; takes therefore
a splendid polish, again “The British
museum” has saved a good specimen.</p>

<h3>NEW GUINEA.</h3>

and the mouth piece is cunningly arranged
by making a small hole at the joint

which cannot be called a bowl but rather
a cigar or cigarette holder is always at right
angles to the thick stem which averages
14<sup>in</sup> &amp; 15<sup>in.</sup> in length. The ornamentation
like that of “CHINAM” cases is very delicate
&amp; refined. The South Pacific affords
us a shell pipe and from <span class="u">SAVO</span> &amp;

<h4>N. AMERICA.</h4>

<p class="hang1">There is hardly room to do justice
to a good north American “Pipe of Peace”
on these small pages but those who are
really interested in the Pipe customs
&amp; functions of the Indian tribes will
derive much pleasure &amp; information too
from consulting “CATLINs” works on
those subjects. The best pipes have
flat stems much ornamented &amp; the
Bowls of elaborate design are very
quaint &amp; original the simpler ones
are red the more curious in a
dark slate &amp; a kind of green stone.
The British museum has naturally
a very fine collection of all the varieties
of both materials—.</p>

<h3>ARCTIC PIPES<br />&amp; LAPLAND.</h3>

<p class="hang1">In this part of the world there is
not much material for the making
of Pipes for the only wood is generally
brought up by the kindly
Gulf Stream from the West Indies
even to NOVA ZEMBLA still the
sparse Inhabitants fall back
on the tooth of the “<span class="u">Walrus</span>” &amp; very
comely looking pipes are the result.
The Laplanders pipe is
generally made of thin iron
which may be accounted for by
the proximity of the once very famous
“<span class="u">SWEDISH</span>” Iron.</p>

<h2>IGNITION.</h2>

<h3>BORNEO.</h3>

<p class="hang1">After the Tobacco, &amp; the Pipes, very
naturally occurs the Question as
to getting a Light. The friction of
Two dry pieces of Wood is the most
primitive method still in vogue where
modern methods are still unknown
and the light “HIBISCUS” wood is
the easiest of all to obtain fire from
but in <span class="u">BORNEO</span>. The Dyaks of the
<span class="u">KYAN tribe</span> are most scientific
they produced it by compressed
air &amp; do still &amp; we only know of
two other places <span class="u">SUMATRA</span> &amp; the
North of <span class="u">BURMAH</span> where this method
is known &amp; in use.</p>

<h3>S. AMERICA.</h3>

<h4>“<span class="u">MACHEROS</span>”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   FLINT &amp; STEEL.</h4>

<p class="hang1">Doubtless, The Spaniards carried with them
all through their Conquests of S. AMERICA
their “MACHEROS” which is a tube to
carry the match. To the tube is generally
attached a chain leading to a hook
which the top pulls out with the
match for the purpose of lighting
with the <span class="u">flint &amp; steel</span>. Some 50
years ago the Peruvian &amp; Chilian
Ladies worked very beautiful match
with Lace let in. Some MACHEROS
were of Gold, some of Silver.
In <span class="u">India</span> they are larger
and are called “<span class="u">RAMASWAMI</span>.”</p>

<h3>THE ANTEPENULTIMATE<br />
of IGNITION.</h3>

<p class="hang1">The Flint &amp; Tinder Pistol combination
was a very great advance when
first introduced, striking a light in
the dark with a Flint &amp; steel is not
easy &amp; all who have tried will say
so, then the old Brimstone flat
matches were odorous, next we had
French “Amadou” &amp; a match like a
walking stick topped with Brimstone
explosive matter, then smaller ones
followed by “TANDSTIKERS” &amp; now
hand in hand “VESUVIANS” of the
delightful Wax “VESTAS.”</p>

<b>Transcriber’s Notes:</b></div>

<p>Very few edits were made to this book with the exception of trying to remove
what seemed to be editing dots vs. actual periods, fullstops, commas and em-dashes,
and adding quotation marks now and then to balance them. Ellipses are two .. in this
text. The remaining changes are listed below.</p>

<p>Page 32, repeated word “of” removed from text. Original read
(cruel scenes of
of useless)</p>

<p>Page 64, “mixturr” changed to “mixture” (this case a mixture)</p>

<p>Page 90, “he” changed to “the” (years ago to the)</p>
